# Mortgage Calculator

Written in JS and Bulma CSS.

I have a highly detailed mortgage calculator excel spreadsheet that I built when I was looking to purchase my first home. 

The spreadsheet acts as a guide, and makes you aware of how easily interest adds up, how important the down payment is, and how any additional monthly payments affects the duration of the loan and lowers your interest payment. Of course we're all aware of these things, but when you crunch the data and see the numbers in front of you it affects your behavior and subconsciously encourages you to make additional payments to your house. 

My goal is to convert that spreadsheet into a web app. 

## Coming Soon
1. Total Interest Paid
2. Total Paid
3. Percent Interest Paid
4. If you did not put 20% down, after how many months will you reach 22% equity? (22% equity is required to stop paying PMI (private mortgage insurance = pointless))
5. If down payment is less then 20%, what is my PMI?
6. Additional Payment Input Amount
7. Re-calculate, new monthly payment, new payoff time, new total interest paid, new percent interest paid, when will you reach 22% equity.
8. And most important: Total Savings (after i.e. $50 additional monthly payment). 

Total savings can be significant, even with as little as an extra $50/month. 

That is what I want to show on this web app.
